# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
using the print function, display the distance between the two points
### Step 5: 
End the program.

### PROGRAM:
```
def circulate():
    l =eval(input())
    n=int(input())
    l=l[n:]+l[:n]
    print("After circulating the values are:",l)
```

  


### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the distance of the two points is sucessfully executed and displayed.
